# RouteOptimize Solutions

## Project Overview

RouteOptimize Solutions is an innovative project that leverages Generative AI (GenAI) to address challenges in the airline industry, specifically focusing on optimizing flight routes and delivering personalized travel experiences. The project utilizes advanced algorithms, real-time data analysis, and natural language processing to provide a chatbot interface for understanding natural language queries and offering customized flight recommendations.

## Key Features

- Chatbot interface for natural language queries
- Customized flight recommendations
- Flight route optimization
- Real-time data analysis
- Advanced GenAI algorithms

## Technology Stack

- Python
- OpenAI API
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Colab

## Project Structure

1. **Setup**: Initialization of the environment, including library imports and API authentication.
2. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and preprocessing of the dataset for model training.
3. **Fine-tuning**: Creation and optimization of a custom model for the specific use case.
4. **Inference**: Utilization of the fine-tuned model for generating responses to user queries.

## Installation
